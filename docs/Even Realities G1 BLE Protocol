Even Realities G1 BLE Protocol
This doc aims to outline the BLE protocol for the Even Realities G1. The G1 operates with two BLE radios, one for the left arm and one for the right. Some commands need to be sent individually to both arms and some are only sent to one arm. Each radio operates as a stream of packets using the Nordic BLE UART.

Generic Command Response
Many commands will simply respond with a generic success/failure message. The header will repeat the command id back, and one additional byte which will be either success or failure. This is recorded here and referenced by all commands that operate this way to avoid duplicating the same response for all such messages.
Response

Commands
Commands are messages the App can send to the glasses. The glasses may optionally respond.
Control
Commands that send one off information to the glasses for them to act on.
Microphone Control (0x0E)
	enable:
    	0: Disable the MIC (turn off sound pickup).
    	1: Enable the MIC (turn on sound pickup).

Response

	Command: 0x0E
	rsp_status (Response Status):
    	0xC9: Success
    	0xCA: Failure
	enable:
    	0: MIC disabled.

Set the dashboard mode, currently has three modes: minimal, dual, full


Set Teleprompter Text (0x09)
??
Set Navigation Info (0x0A)
??
Set Head Up Angle Settings (0x0B)
Sets the angle at which the display turns on when the wearer looks up. Send to the right arm. Response is generic

Response

Set Display Settings (0x26)
Height and Depth
Control the display’s height and depth. Must be called twice, first with the preview bit set to 1, and then a few seconds later with the bit set 0. The glasses will stay on permanently until the preview=0 command is sent, or if the preview=1 is not sent, the glasses will reject the setting. The packet size of 08 seems to indicate it is a height+depth packet.

Response

Voice Activation on Head Lift Settings
Enables or Disables streaming audio to the phone when the head is lifted. A packet size of 06 seems to indicate the packet contains this setting instead of the height and depth settings.

Need to parse through the packets below:

Set Wear Detection Settings (0x27)
Enable or disable Wear Detection. When enabled, additional 0xF5 messages are sent when worn or not. Response is generic.

Set Notification Auto Display Settings (0x4F)
Enables or disables the notification auto displaying on the glasses and the amount of time that the notification will be shown. Send to both sides. Response is generic.

Unknown
Set Calendar Event(0x58)
??
System Commands
Set Debug Mode (0x23 0x6C)
Enables debug logging on the glasses. Response is generic. Oddly enough, 00 is enable while C1 is disable. Log lines will have a packet header of 0xF4.

Send Reboot (0x23 0x72)
Reboots the glasses. No response.

Get Firmware Information(0x23 74)
Send and the device should respond with fw build information

Response
This response kind of sucks because it has no header and is just raw ASCII data. Currently it always starts with “net”.

Messages
These are messages the glasses will send to the app unprompted when an event happens or they want to put the status in.
General Status (0x22)
Need to parse out the exact meaning of the fields in these packets, but these are sent periodically from the glasses and contain information about the state of the glasses.

# Even Demo

## Even AI
The general process of the Even AI function is as follows: After the app and glasses are 
connected via dual Bluetooth, long press the left-side TouchBar on the glasses to enter the 
Even AI activation state. At this point, the app will receive the [0xF5, 0x17] command from the 
glasses. The app then needs to send a command [0x0E, 0x01] to the glasses to activate the 
right-side microphone for recording. Once the microphone is successfully activated, the app 
will receive a real-time audio stream in LC3 format. Keep pressing until speaking is finished, 
the maximum supported recording duration is 30 seconds. After the recording is finished, the 
app needs to convert the audio stream into text, which is then sent to the large model for a 
response. After the app successfully obtains the response from the large model, it can send 
the result to the glasses according to the Bluetooth protocol. By default, the result is 
transmitted automatically, page by page. During transmission, a single tap on the TouchBar 
will switch to manual mode, with the left-side TouchBar used for page-up and the right-side 
TouchBar for page-down. A double-tap on the TouchBar will directly exit the Even AI function.


## Image Sending
Image transmission currently supports 1-bit, 576*136 pixel BMP images (see vendor demo assets for reference samples).
The core process includes three steps: 
- 1. Divide the BMP image data into packets (each packet is 194 bytes), then add 0x15 command and syncID to the front of the packet, and send it to the dual BLE in the order of the packets (the left and right sides can be sent independently at the same time). The first packet needs to insert 4 bytes of glasses end storage address 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00, so the first packet data is ([0x15, index & 0xff, 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00], pack), and other packets do not need addresses 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00;
- 2. After sending the last packet, it is necessary to send the packet end command [0x20, 0x0d, 0x0e] to the dual BLE;
- 3. After the packet end command in step 2 is correctly replied, send the CRC check command to the dual BLE through the 0x16 command. When calculating the CRC, it is necessary to consider the glasses end storage address added when sending the first BMP packet.
     
For a specific example, click the icon in the upper right corner of the App homepage to enter the Features page. The page contains three buttons: BMP 1, BMP 2, and Exit, which represent the transmission and display of picture 1, the transmission and display of picture 2, and the exit of picture transmission and display.


## Text Sending
Currently, the demo supports sending text directly to the glasses and displaying it.
The core steps are as follows:
- 1. Divide the input text into lines according to the actual display width of the glasses (the value in the demo is 488, which can be fine-tuned) and the font size you want (the value in the demo is 21, which can be customized);
- 2. Combine the number of lines per screen (the value in the demo is 5) and the size limit of each ble packet to divide the text divided in step 1 into packets (5 lines are displayed per screen in the demo, the first three lines form one packet, and the last two lines form one packet);
- 3. Use the Text Sending protocol in the protocol section below to send the multi-packet data in step 2 to the glasses by screen (a timer is used in the demo to send each screen of text in sequence).



## Instructions
G1’s dual Bluetooth communication is unique, each arm corresponds to a separate BLE 
connection. During communication, unless the protocol specifies sending data to only one 
side (e.g., microphone activation to the right), the app should: 
- First send data to the left side. 
- Then send data to the right side after receiving a successful acknowledgment from the left. 
 Also, consider the glasses' display width limitation: during the Even AI function, the 
maximum width is 488 pixels, with eac
