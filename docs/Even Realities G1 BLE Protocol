Even Realities G1 BLE Protocol
This doc aims to outline the BLE protocol for the Even Realities G1. The G1 operates with two BLE radios, one for the left arm and one for the right. Some commands need to be sent individually to both arms and some are only sent to one arm. Each radio operates as a stream of packets using the Nordic BLE UART.

Generic Command Response
Many commands will simply respond with a generic success/failure message. The header will repeat the command id back, and one additional byte which will be either success or failure. This is recorded here and referenced by all commands that operate this way to avoid duplicating the same response for all such messages.
Response

Commands
Commands are messages the App can send to the glasses. The glasses may optionally respond.
Control
Commands that send one off information to the glasses for them to act on.

Set the dashboard mode, currently has three modes: minimal, dual, full


Set Teleprompter Text (0x09)
??
Set Navigation Info (0x0A)
??
Set Head Up Angle Settings (0x0B)
Sets the angle at which the display turns on when the wearer looks up. Send to the right arm. Response is generic

Response

Set Display Settings (0x26)
Height and Depth
Control the display’s height and depth. Must be called twice, first with the preview bit set to 1, and then a few seconds later with the bit set 0. The glasses will stay on permanently until the preview=0 command is sent, or if the preview=1 is not sent, the glasses will reject the setting. The packet size of 08 seems to indicate it is a height+depth packet.

Response

Voice Activation on Head Lift Settings
Enables or Disables streaming audio to the phone when the head is lifted. A packet size of 06 seems to indicate the packet contains this setting instead of the height and depth settings.

Need to parse through the packets below:

Set Wear Detection Settings (0x27)
Enable or disable Wear Detection. When enabled, additional 0xF5 messages are sent when worn or not. Response is generic.

Set Notification Auto Display Settings (0x4F)
Enables or disables the notification auto displaying on the glasses and the amount of time that the notification will be shown. Send to both sides. Response is generic.

Unknown
Set Calendar Event(0x58)
??
System Commands
Set Debug Mode (0x23 0x6C)
Enables debug logging on the glasses. Response is generic. Oddly enough, 00 is enable while C1 is disable. Log lines will have a packet header of 0xF4.

Send Reboot (0x23 0x72)
Reboots the glasses. No response.

Get Firmware Information(0x23 74)
Send and the device should respond with fw build information

Response
This response kind of sucks because it has no header and is just raw ASCII data. Currently it always starts with “net”.

Messages
These are messages the glasses will send to the app unprompted when an event happens or they want to put the status in.
General Status (0x22)
Need to parse out the exact meaning of the fields in these packets, but these are sent periodically from the glasses and contain information about the state of the glasses.

# Even Demo

## Even AI
The general process of the Even AI function is as follows: After the app and glasses are 
connected via dual Bluetooth, long press the left-side TouchBar on the glasses to enter the 
Even AI activation state. At this point, the app will receive the [0xF5, 0x17] command from the 
glasses. The app then needs to send a command [0x0E, 0x01] to the glasses to activate the 
right-side microphone for recording. Once the microphone is successfully activated, the app 
will receive a real-time audio stream in LC3 format. Keep pressing until speaking is finished, 
the maximum supported recording duration is 30 seconds. After the recording is finished, the 
app needs to convert the audio stream into text, which is then sent to the large model for a 
response. After the app successfully obtains the response from the large model, it can send 
the result to the glasses according to the Bluetooth protocol. By default, the result is 
transmitted automatically, page by page. During transmission, a single tap on the TouchBar 
will switch to manual mode, with the left-side TouchBar used for page-up and the right-side 
TouchBar for page-down. A double-tap on the TouchBar will directly exit the Even AI function.


## Image Sending
Image transmission currently supports 1-bit, 576*136 pixel BMP images (see vendor demo assets for reference samples).
The core process includes three steps: 
- 1. Divide the BMP image data into packets (each packet is 194 bytes), then add 0x15 command and syncID to the front of the packet, and send it to the dual BLE in the order of the packets (the left and right sides can be sent independently at the same time). The first packet needs to insert 4 bytes of glasses end storage address 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00, so the first packet data is ([0x15, index & 0xff, 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00], pack), and other packets do not need addresses 0x00, 0x1c, 0x00, 0x00;
- 2. After sending the last packet, it is necessary to send the packet end command [0x20, 0x0d, 0x0e] to the dual BLE;
- 3. After the packet end command in step 2 is correctly replied, send the CRC check command to the dual BLE through the 0x16 command. When calculating the CRC, it is necessary to consider the glasses end storage address added when sending the first BMP packet.
     
For a specific example, click the icon in the upper right corner of the App homepage to enter the Features page. The page contains three buttons: BMP 1, BMP 2, and Exit, which represent the transmission and display of picture 1, the transmission and display of picture 2, and the exit of picture transmission and display.


## Text Sending
Currently, the demo supports sending text directly to the glasses and displaying it.
The core steps are as follows:
- 1. Divide the input text into lines according to the actual display width of the glasses (the value in the demo is 488, which can be fine-tuned) and the font size you want (the value in the demo is 21, which can be customized);
- 2. Combine the number of lines per screen (the value in the demo is 5) and the size limit of each ble packet to divide the text divided in step 1 into packets (5 lines are displayed per screen in the demo, the first three lines form one packet, and the last two lines form one packet);
- 3. Use the Text Sending protocol in the protocol section below to send the multi-packet data in step 2 to the glasses by screen (a timer is used in the demo to send each screen of text in sequence).



## Instructions
G1’s dual Bluetooth communication is unique, each arm corresponds to a separate BLE 
connection. During communication, unless the protocol specifies sending data to only one 
side (e.g., microphone activation to the right), the app should: 
- First send data to the left side. 
- Then send data to the right side after receiving a successful acknowledgment from the left. 
 Also, consider the glasses' display width limitation: during the Even AI function, the 
maximum width is 488 pixels, with eac

🔬 Section 13 – Evolution of the Even Realities G1 Protocol and Firmware Ecosystem

13.1 Overview

Through comparison of multiple firmware revisions (v1.4.5 → v1.6.3), live nRF Connect traces, and disassembly of the Even Glassbox Upgrade Tool package, a coherent view of the G1 system has emerged.
The G1 platform is not a static BLE accessory — it is a two-part ecosystem:
	1.	a dual-lens BLE telemetry network operating on a mixed binary + UART protocol, and
	2.	a firmware distribution & upgrade framework using USB serial and pre-production cloud endpoints.

Each phase of the patches contributed new clarity about how these two layers interact and evolve.

⸻

13.2 Evolution of the BLE Protocol

Firmware	Characteristics	Implications
v1.4.5	UART-style text exchanges; ACK as literal “OK”.	The device behaved like a transparent serial bridge. No encryption, no binary framing; 8-bit ASCII only.
v1.5.0	Hybrid stage — both text and binary ACKs (0xC9); added uptime telemetry (0x37).	Marked transition to a packetized design; firmware began using a unified command header but still accepted plain strings for backward compatibility.
v1.5.6	Dual-lens architecture introduced; each lens identified separately; firmware info exposed via 0x2C 02.	The app must now manage two concurrent GATT sessions that behave like synchronized halves of a single device.
v1.6.3	Fully binary command structure; additional telemetry opcodes (0x39 system status, 0x32 activation angle); strict ACK timing; dropped text responses.	Established the modern “production” protocol. All commands expect binary ACK within 250 ms. Text parsing exists only for legacy support.

From these, we learn that text responses are a legacy compatibility feature, not an alternate mode — any delay or “HELLO timeout” during the handshake often results from firmware sending a plain “OK” while the app waits for a binary ACK.

⸻

13.3 Dual-Lens Connection Model

Diagnostics confirm that the left lens acts as the master in both Bluetooth and operational sequencing.
The right lens never begins bonding or telemetry until the left lens completes its warm-up handshake.
This sequencing ensures consistent MTU negotiation and ACK synchronization.
When bonding fails or the HELLO watchdog resets prematurely, the right side never starts — producing the recurring “left-only connect sequence” loops observed in logs.

The architectural takeaway: dual-lens unification already works; remaining instability stems from runtime ACK interpretation, not connection logic.

⸻

13.4 The Bonding & Watchdog Paradox

The Moncchichi app’s invalid-key fallback logic triggers bond removal whenever the expected CMD_HELLO ACK isn’t seen within 5 s.
Because v1.6.x firmware often replies with a textual “OK” warm-up rather than a structured ACK packet, this watchdog interprets success as failure and re-initiates bonding.
Hence, the recurrent pattern:

BOND_BONDED → "OK" → watchdog timeout → removeBond() → reconnect loop

Key insight: the system’s “bond disappearing” symptom originates entirely from an internal timeout, not Android or firmware faults.

⸻

13.5 Telemetry Decoding Behavior

Newly parsed frames (0x2B, 0x2C, 0x37, 0x39) revealed that:
	•	Battery, wearing, case-open, and charging states are consolidated under a unified 0x2B/0x2C telemetry group.
	•	The binary format is consistent across firmware lines, confirming long-term stability of opcode mapping.
	•	Textual UART lines appearing in some logs (“OK”, firmware banners, diagnostic strings) are voluntary debug prints, not required protocol responses.

Thus, BLE telemetry can now be treated as structured binary messages, with UTF-8 parsing reserved only for human-readable banners.

⸻

13.6 Firmware Upgrade Architecture (USB/Serial Layer)

Reverse-engineering of the official Even Glassbox Upgrade Tool uncovered the vendor’s firmware maintenance workflow:
	1.	The desktop app is a Qt 6 front-end wrapping a proprietary EvenRealities.dll.
	2.	The DLL handles port detection, bootloader entry, image streaming, and CRC verification.
	3.	Firmware packages are named Even_G1_Case_*.bin, later split into app_update.bin and net_core_app_update.bin.
	4.	The tool communicates with the staging endpoint webapi-pre.evenreal.co, implying a production counterpart.
	5.	The API model uses progress callbacks: detect → download → transmit → verify → result.

These findings show that the Even ecosystem already exposes a layered DFU pipeline, and the Moncchichi Hub can interoperate by mirroring this callback structure.

⸻

13.7 Structural Insights

Domain	Discovery	Significance
BLE layer	Binary and text coexist; 0xC9 ACKs drive timing.	Parser must tolerate both without rebonding.
Dual-lens coordination	Left initiates, right waits.	Keep sequencing logic; focus fixes on ACK validation.
Bond handling	App removes bond on false timeout.	Core cause of recurring disconnects.
Telemetry	Stable binary format since v1.5.6.	Long-term compatibility likely.
Firmware updates	Vendor DLL confirms two-image DFU structure.	Android can replicate later using BLE or USB.
Server model	webapi-pre.evenreal.co provides manifests & bundles.	Enables in-app version checking without flashing.

This layered structure clarifies that BLE telemetry and firmware DFU are parallel, not overlapping communication paths — BLE handles runtime operations, while USB/DFU handles lifecycle upgrades.

⸻

13.9 Practical Understanding Gained
	1.	The protocol is now mature and stable. Opcode and packet layout consistency since v1.5.6 suggest backward-safe evolution.
	2.	App instability originates from logic assumptions, not hardware faults. False “invalid key” resets and UI desynchronization stem from watchdog design.
	3.	Firmware distribution uses a standard manifest + dual-binary layout. This makes future OTA or in-app DFU practical with minimal risk.
	4.	Left-lens priority remains critical. It is part of the hardware design, not an app quirk.
	5.	Vendor DLL mirrors a clean callback model. This can inform future Android DFU or telemetry pipeline designs.

⸻

13.10 Summary

All recent patches, traces, and extracted vendor tools converge on one truth:

The G1 system is already architecturally complete — what remains is aligning the Moncchichi Hub’s interpretation with that reality.

	•	The BLE layer is well-defined; adjustments lie in timing and acknowledgment handling.
	•	The firmware layer is a distinct, service-based upgrade pipeline; safe to integrate later.
	•	The dual-lens model and binary telemetry schema are consistent across firmware lines, ensuring long-term compatibility.

This consolidated understanding forms the foundation for any future code work, DFU integration, or protocol-driven diagnostics inside the Moncchichi Hub.
