## ‚öôÔ∏è ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
CURRENT_PHASE: Phase 4.0 rev 3 ‚Äî BLE Core Fusion (Full Bidirectional Communication & HUD Bridge)
PHASE_OBJECTIVE: Rebuild the BLE stack to support dual-lens G1 glasses with fast, fault-tolerant, ack-based communication while preserving the monochrome Even Realities visual language.
ROLLING_WAVE: Wave 1 focus with Wave 2 scaffolding (HUD broadcast hooks + diagnostics tags).

## üß© CODEX TASK ZONE

### Wave 1 ‚Äî Connectivity & Telemetry Core (Milestones 1‚Äì4)
- Establish **MoncchichiBleService** as a persistent foreground service that binds directly (no AIDL) and supervises two `BluetoothGatt` sessions (left/right).
- Implement a coroutine-backed write queue shared by both lenses; enforce 5 ms pacing and await `0xC9` ack packets before dequeuing the next command.
- Negotiate 251-byte MTU (`0x4D 0xFB`); split payloads ‚â§ 200 B and retry up to three times before marking the link *DEGRADED*.
- Decode RX notifications asynchronously into `BleTelemetryRepository`, producing flows for battery %, uptime, RSSI, and firmware revision.
- Heartbeat cadence: send `0x25 <seq>` every 15‚Äì30 s per lens; expect `0x25 0x04` ack and trigger auto-reconnect on timeout.

#### Service & Characteristic Map
| Role | UUID | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Primary Service | `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | Nordic UART Service shared by both lenses |
| TX (App ‚Üí Glasses) | `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | Commands serialized across lenses |
| RX (Glasses ‚Üí App) | `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | Telemetry, HUD acks, and unsolicited events |

#### Outbound Command Reference
| Action | Command | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Display Text | `0x4E` | UTF-8 payload ‚â§ 200 B, ack per chunk |
| Display Image | `0x15` | 194 B bitmap + CRC; send to each lens |
| Clear HUD | `0x18` | Reset display before/after messages |
| Battery Query | `0x2C 0x01` | Expect `%` in response payload |
| Uptime Query | `0x37` | Seconds since boot |
| Heartbeat | `0x25 <seq>` | Expect `0x25 0x04` ack |
| Set MTU | `0x4D 0xFB` | Negotiate 251 MTU |
| Reboot | `0x23 0x72` | Soft reboot (no response) |

#### Inbound Handling
```kotlin
when (firstByte) {
    0x2C -> handleBattery()
    0x37 -> handleUptime()
    0xF5 -> handleEvent()
    else -> logRawPacket()
}
```
- Event packets prefixed with `0xF5` (touch, wear, case open) must be surfaced to diagnostics.
- All telemetry snapshots feed into `DiagnosticRepository` for assistant summarization.

### Wave 2 ‚Äî HUD, Events & Diagnostics (Milestones 5‚Äì7)
- `sendHudMessage(text, durationMs)` broadcasts sequentially to left/right lenses with 5 ms offset and logs `[HUD] Flash: "..."`.
- Persist the default HUD baseline so it can be restored after transient messages.
- Map gesture/event codes to high-level actions (tap, swipe, case open) and expose them via a shared flow to UI and assistant modules.
- Extend `ConsoleInterpreter` to tag entries with `[BLE]`, `[HUD]`, or `[DIAG]` plus sequence/ack metadata for troubleshooting.

### Wave 3 ‚Äî Assistant Bridge (Milestone 8)
- Surface telemetry state via `AssistantDiagnosticBridge` so GPT replies can reference battery %, firmware version, RSSI, and last sync time.
- Ensure offline cache continuity: assistant must respond with latest stored telemetry when network is unavailable.

### Reliability & Timing Matrix
| Constraint | Guideline |
|------------|-----------|
| Chunk delay | ‚âà 5 ms |
| Ack expectation | `0xC9` before next command |
| Retry policy | 3√ó then mark link DEGRADED |
| Heartbeat interval | 30 s (per lens) |
| Round-trip goal | ‚â§ 2 s |

### Console & Diagnostics Tags
| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[BLE]` | Connection and command state |
| `[DIAG]` | Telemetry snapshots |
| `[HUD]` | HUD updates and events |

All logs are retained in `MemoryRepository` for assistant summarization and export.

### Even Realities Monochrome Theme
| Element | Color | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Background | `#000000` | Root surfaces |
| Surface/Card | `#1A1A1A` | Dialogs and console |
| Border | `#2A2A2A` | Dividers |
| Text/Icon | `#FFFFFF` | Primary content |
| Secondary Text | `#CCCCCC` | Hints and timestamps |
| Disabled | `#777777` | Muted labels |
| Accent (Console) | `#A691F2` | Highlight ack/seq entries |

Typography: Header 12 sp white semi-bold, body 14 sp white regular, timestamp 10 sp gray.

### Acceptance Benchmarks
| Scenario | Expected Result |
|----------|----------------|
| Dual connection | Status shows üü¢ Connected (L/R) |
| Battery query | Console logs `[BLE] Battery 92 % ‚Ä¢ Case 89 %` |
| Heartbeat timeout | `[BLE] Timeout ‚Äì Reconnecting` is emitted and service retries |
| Touchpad tap | `[BLE] Event 0xF5 17 (Tap Right)` logged |
| HUD message | `[HUD] Flash: "Connected"` on both lenses |
| Ack sequence | `[BLE] ACK C9 seq=42` recorded |
